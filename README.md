# Space-Invaders
This is a game I have made during the CodeGorilla Bootcamp. It is made using the Unity game engine over the course of a couple of days. The objective is to shoot the Aliens and defeat them all before they reach your base. The spaceship can move up with the left mouse buttonleft and right and the left mouse button is used for fireing.
